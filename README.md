# Food scrap drop-off sites in NYC

Derived from a Google Map embedded at this [Department of Sanitation of NY web page](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/residential-food-waste-drop-off-sites.shtml).

Some of the drop-off sites were extracted directly from the [KML exported from the Google Map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1oMdEEzEuacc9pbwDTJTBbDiaQHI); another part of the sites were in the KML but had no latitude/longitude coordinates, so I geocoded them using the Google Geocoding API. Did not thoroughly check the accuracy of the geocoding result.

Coordinates are in WGS84, EPSG:4326.
